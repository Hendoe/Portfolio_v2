        <h3>Hello! Welcome to my Page!</h3>
        <p>I am currently studying Javascript, HTML, and CSS with <a href='https://www.thinkful.com/'>Thinkful</a> in Austin, TX.</p>
        <p>Most of my 20s was spent playing with numerous local Austin bands. And then I took off years to work and explore Colorado.</p>
        <p>When I turned 25 I decided to slow down a little bit, and get an education. In May of 2020 I earned my Associate's Degree, and I am now pursuing 
           the next phase of my education by learning to code.</p>

      <p>I am currently building an extensive skillset in programming. Below you can find a selection of Projects that showcase my abilities. Coding is an activity

          <h3>Commander 9000</h3>
          <h4>A series of AI Modifications to CnC RA</h4>
          <p>This is a mod for the videogame Command and Conquer: Red Alert that signifactly increases the intelligence and tactial decision making of the 
             game's built Skirmish AI. It also comes with several custom created maps (by yours truly) that allow the Artifical Intelligence to really show off
             what it is capable of. The mod required taking old school code and brining it the modern era. I had to do a lot of research to figure out solutions 
             to a great deal of problems; from unit pathfinding to getting the AI to prioritze certain buildings and troops to purchase so as to effectively
             counter the player, as well as how to use them in the most efficient way. It also required dozens of hours of playtesting, to find out exactly 
             how to create maps that allowed organic, enagaging, and satsifying confrontations to develop over the course of a match.</p>

          <h3>Starman</h3>
          <h4>Facebook Messenger on Cell Phone to TV Sound App</h4>
          <p>An app that will let the user stream anything playing on their phone straight to their Television. It can take embedded messages in Facebook messenger, 
             wheter it's videos or just audio, and stream it onto any Television connected to the same WiFi signal. Building this app required a lot of time in HTMl and 
             CSS to get the perfect layout that was simple and clean, easy for the user to navigate without spending any unnecessary time navigating. Beyond that,
             it required me to develop an entirely new skill, by learning how to get the app to interface with a WiFi Signal and transmit data over a network.</p>
